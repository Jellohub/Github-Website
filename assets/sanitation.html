        We place a big emphasis on keeping our plants and the products clean. All employees wear hair nets
        and beard nets when necessary; employees working with food hands-on are required to wear gloves
        at all times; ripped gloves must be replaced with new ones. As for the product itself, we perform
        quality checks at every stage of development. Before the product enters the packaging totes, it goes
        through a metal detector that goes off if any pieces of metal are detected. If it is detected, the entire
        tote is discarded to ensure no contaminated product slips through. Every couple hours, samples of the final
        product are put into special plastic bags for lab testing. This tests for any pathogens in the product.

            Gloves are used all the time in our plants.
            We have four sizes of gloves: small, medium,
            large, and x-large. Aside from regular
            plastic gloves, we also have special gloves
            for people that handle product all day. These
            gloves aren't thrown away and you don't need
            to replace them all day.

            We have soap and sanitizer dispensers throughout the plants. Employees are
            required to use them every time they enter the plant for the start
            of their shift, after they return from their breaks, and any other time
            they exit the production line.

            To prevent hair from falling into our products, we require that everyone
            wear a hair net. If someone has a beard, we provide beard nets as well.
